che ci fa sentire bene quando facciamo qualcosa di bello per gli altri....

un giusto mix tra il ricevere e lâospitare...

loro lo percepiscono e torneranno volenteri......

Hello ... are Valeria,
I majored in physical education,
are a great sport .....
but in my life I have always loved
meet new people
and that is why I decided to open a Bed and Breakfast,
because I believe that the art of hospitality you certainly can not learn ...
but being hospitable is something that comes from the heart ...
that makes us feel good when we do something nice for others ....
I find that the true meaning of hospitality is just that ...
the right mix between the receive and accommodate ...
keeping in mind that if we are genuinely happy to have guests ...
they see it and will be back volenteri ......
I like to take care of my guests ...
their welfare and their serenity ...
for all the time you spend together .... . :)

Virgil lived here, looking at the poetic and picturesque coasts of Vesuvius and Sorrento. He inspired Dante, Boccaccio and Petrarca.

Maria del Porto founded by Jacopo Sannazzaro in 1524.<br />Mergellina has always been decanted for its beauty and panorama. Over the centuries it has been transformed to leave the place at the famous seafront of via Caracciolo. It is within walking distance of the symbols of the Parthenon culture: the Castel dell'Ovo, Piazza del Plebiscito, the Molo Beverello, the Pier of Mergellina.
